# Event Sampler + Firehose Pattern

# Pattern Summary:
This pattern implements an event sampling strategy using EventBridge and Lambda, where a subset of incoming events (e.g., 20%) are captured and forwarded to Amazon Kinesis Firehose for durable storage in S3. Itâ€™s ideal for observability, analytics, and cost-efficient monitoring when only a portion of events need to be retained.

             | Lambda: Sampler     |

# Use Cases:
- Sampling high-throughput analytics data for cost-effective observability
- Capturing event telemetry or metadata for auditing
- Feeding downstream dashboards or training datasets with partial data

# Key Components: Resource/Purpose
- AWS::Events::EventBus	Custom bus (sampler-bus) receives analytics events
- AWS::Lambda::Function	Samples incoming events with a 20% probability
- AWS::KinesisFirehose::DeliveryStream	Buffers and writes sampled data to S3
- AWS::S3::Bucket	Stores sampled event JSONs
- AWS::Events::Rule	Routes matching events to the sampler Lambda
- AWS::IAM::Role	Grants Lambda and Firehose appropriate access

# Event Pattern:
Only events with this source are sampled:

```
{
  "source": ["analytics.events"]
}
```

You can publish test events with this CLI:

```
aws events put-events --entries '[
  {
    "Source": "analytics.events",
    "DetailType": "UserEvent",
    "Detail": "{\"user_id\": 123, \"event\": \"click\"}",
    "EventBusName": "sampler-bus"
  }
]'
```

# CloudFormation Notes:
- Firehose is created in DirectPut mode and writes directly to S3.
- Lambda uses the firehose:PutRecord API to send sampled data.
- IAM permissions are scoped to Firehose, S3, and basic CloudWatch logging.
- EventBridge Rule connects the custom event bus to the Lambda.
- S3 bucket structure will follow Firehose's default time-based partitioning unless configured otherwise.
